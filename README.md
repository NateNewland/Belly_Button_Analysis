# Belly_Button_Analysis

## Overview
In this challenge we were tasked with creating a script to make an interactive webpage with a dropdown menu to help users look at data based on how often you wash your belly button.
The objective was to provide an easy to use website that also provides the data we were given. This challenge tested our knowledge on JavaScript and new skills we learned with creating
Event Listeners and dropdown menus in a GUI like setup.
